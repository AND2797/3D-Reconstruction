# 3D-Reconstruction
Implementation of stereo-reconstruction algorithm. Reprojects points in relative 3D space using triangulation and stereo-matching from a pair of calibrated images.

## Algorithm
**Given:** Stereo-rectified pair of images, given camera intrinsics (K), point correspondences between left and right images.
